# AnnotatedPapers

Repository to hold papers I am reading and my comments on them. Papers are organized into folders named by the ML subfields most relevant to them. The only exception to this is the `READ` folder, which contains papers I am reading or have already read. If I intend to annotate a paper, it will move from this folder to the corresponding `[subfield]/backlog/` folder.

## Application

[Drawboard](https://www.drawboard.com/pdf/) is the application I use for annotating PDFs.

## Color Code

In all the annotated papers, I will highlight text and write comments according to the following color code:

**RED**: bad or confusing

**GREEN**: good or novel

**BLUE**: normal
