# AnnotatedPapers

Repository to hold papers I am reading and my comments on them. Papers are organized into folders named by the ML subfields most relevant to them.

## Application

[Drawboard](https://www.drawboard.com/pdf/) is the application I use for annotating PDFs.

## Color Code

In all the annotated papers, I will highlight text and write comments according to the following color code:

**RED**: bad or confusing

**GREEN**: good or novel

**BLUE**: normal


## backlog

Every directory contains a subdirectory called backlog that contains papers I intend to annotate and/or are in the middle of annotating.
