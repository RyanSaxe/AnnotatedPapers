# AnnotatedPapers

You can view all the papers I have annotated [on my website](https://www.ryansaxe.com/#annotated-papers) if you would prefer that medium.

The purpose of this repository is to hold papers I am reading and papers I have read. And I provide in depth annotations to a subset of these papers. Non-annotated papers are in the `READ` folder, and annotated papers are organized into folders named by the ML subfields most relevant to them.

## Application

[Drawboard](https://www.drawboard.com/pdf/) is the application I use for annotating PDFs.

## Color Code

In all the annotated papers, I will highlight text and write comments according to the following color code:

**RED**: bad or confusing

**GREEN**: good or novel

**BLUE**: normal
